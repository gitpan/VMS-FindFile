VMS/FindFile version 0.91
=========================

VMS::FindFile is a VMS-specific module which returns all file names
matching a VMS-style wildcard specification.  It acts almost exactly
like the f$search() function in DCL, except that instead of using
context numbers to do multiple concurrent searches, you create
multiple VMS::FindFile objects.

While it is VMS-specific, it's a lot faster than the system-
independent File::Find.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:
